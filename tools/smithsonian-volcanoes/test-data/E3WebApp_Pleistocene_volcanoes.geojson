The complex itself consists of a circular depression with a diameter of about 600 m, a feature that is interpreted to be the remnant of a maar crater (Paulick et al., 2009). This field most likely represents a distal feature of the East Eifel Volcanic Field. The eruption of Rodderberg occurred in two phases. The first was phreatomagmatic, producing xenolith-rich, poorly sorted deposits. The second phase was dominated by Strombolian activity, resulting in xenolith-poor, thick and well-sorted coarse scoria deposits (Paulick et al., 2009). Geochemistry reveals the rocks erupted from the RVC to be leucitic nephelinite. The total erupted volume of material from the RVC eruption is estimated to be about 1.0x10^-2 km3 of magma and 2-3x10^-2 km3 of tephra - a rough order of magnitude estimate. The RVC deposits were previously dated at 26,000-27,000 years before present (IAVCEI 1973), but more recent thermoluminescence data placed the eruption at around 300 ka, during a glacial period in central Europe (Paulick et al., 2009).

The most recent eruptions were considered by the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Vlodavetz and Piip, 1959) to have occurred between about 1300 and 1700 CE from Aniusk (Monni) cone, based on morphological evidence. Later work (Ignatiev, 1994) showed that Monni volcano was partially destroyed by glaciers and phreatic explosions produced by glacial meltwater flowing into the vent. Lava flows from Maly Anyuy volcano flowed onto glacial ice, and explosions induced by glacial meltwater destroyed the cone. The Monni lava flows dammed up drainages, forming lakes. During an early Holocene period of warming, large creeks overflowed from these lakes and deposited fluvial materials. The cone and lava flow are located between the Maly Anyuy and Bolshoy Anyuy rivers, about 75 km SSE of the community of Keperveyem.","Region":"Kamchatka and Mainland Asia","Subregion":"Russia (northeastern)","Latitude":67.154,"Longitude":165.82,"Elevation":1560,"Geologic_Epoch":"Pleistocene"}},{"type":"Feature","id":"Smithsonian_VOTW_Pleistocene_Volcanoes.fid-76d3dfd_16a535685ed_-7a4c","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.893,65.959]},"geometry_name":"GeoLocation","properties":{"Volcano_Number":301805,"Volcano_Name":"Balagan-Tas","Primary_Volcano_Type":"Pyroclastic cone(s)","Country":"Russia","Geological_Summary":"Balagan-Tas is a cinder cone constructed along a fault on the SW flank of the Momskiy Mountains in the NE part of Russia's Sakha Republic.

At least two stages of volcanism are present, the first of which includes lava flows overlying the 20 m terrace of the Dgida, Darkhintuy, and Khammey rivers.  In the Darkhintuy valley the lava flows are overlain by gravels, which are in turn overlaid by lava flows from the Bartoy valley.  Earlier Pleistocene-to-Holocene estimates of the age of the Dgida Basin volcanism (summarized in Whitford Stark, 1987) were modified by later age-dating by Rasskazov et al.

A lava flow from one of three shields named Cerro Coronel was Potassium-Argon dated at 1.2 million years (Bellon and Tournon, 1978). The westernmost part of the Lomas de Colorado is a hill known locally as Chirrip√≥ Atl√°ntico, lying west of the Cocor√≠ lava shield and east of the lengthy north-flowing portion of the R√≠o Chirrip√≥.","Region":"M√©xico and Central America","Subregion":"Costa Rica","Latitude":10.658,"Longitude":-83.721,"Elevation":229,"Geologic_Epoch":"Pleistocene"}},{"type":"Feature","id":"Smithsonian_VOTW_Pleistocene_Volcanoes.fid-76d3dfd_16a535685ed_-791b","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.53,10.586]},"geometry_name":"GeoLocation","properties":{"Volcano_Number":345808,"Volcano_Name":"Tortuguero","Primary_Volcano_Type":"Pyroclastic cone","Country":"Costa Rica","Geological_Summary":"Tortuguero is a Pleistocene pyroclastic cone on the Atlantic coastal plain adjacent to the Caribbean Sea (Barquero and Saenz, 1987; Alvarado, 2000).

It consists principally of a series of rhyolite, rhyodacite, and andesite domes and their associated pyroclastic deposits, with an age of about 3.7 Ma, and an extensive sequence of relatively flat-lying andesite flows, some of which have been dated at 2.8 Ma (Lowe and others, 1982). Both the domes and the flows are intruded by a few rhyodacite and andesitic dikes that appear to originate from a rhyodacite dome near the center of the complex.
