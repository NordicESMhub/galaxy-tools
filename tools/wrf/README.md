# Running WRF from Galaxy portal

## Current status

- These scripts were originally written to ease the usage of WRF
- The documentation on how to use these scripts is still at https://wiki.uio.no/mn/geo/geoit/index.php/WRFand_WRF-CHEM. 
  However, the plan is to migrate all our documentation to github.
